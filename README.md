# Data-structure

*************************************
stack :
create a function that takes a string as a parameter and return true if the string has 
Balanced Brackets and false if it hasn't (using stack)
ex :
"ab(cd{ef}gh)" => true
"ab(cd{ef)" => false 


queue:
write a function that takes an integer K and a queue of integers you have to reverse the order 
of the first K elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.
ex:
k=3
1 2 3 4 5 ====> 3 2 1 4 5


LinkedList:
create a function that takes a linkedlist of letters as a parameter and check if it is palindrome or not 
"A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward"
ex:
m => o => o => m  ..... true 
m => o => o => n  ..... false



recursion:
1- create a function that takes a number and return an array of Fibonacci numbers of this number 
Note: The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
ex:
8
[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21]

2-create a function that takes a number and return the factorial of this number 
ex:
5
120



Extra :

1- Implement a Queue using 2 stacks s1 and s2 
2- create a function that takes a linkedlist and delete the middle node in it and return it 
3- create a function that takes two linkedlists and merge them together 
4- create a function that takes a linkedlist and reverse it
